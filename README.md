# General info
The project is a cinema management application.
The main assumption of the project is the ability to use the application in two modes: regular user and administrator.

Access to administrator mode is possible after entering the correct login and password, and access to the user mode is unlimited. By identifying yourself as a user, the application allows you to:
- viewing lists of movies and reservations
- making a reservation (purchasing a ticket for a movie by selecting seats)
- canceling the selected reservation.

A person identifying as an administrator has access to more advanced options, including:
- management movies (adding, deleting, modifying)
- viewing statistics
- viewing all users reservations

The purpose of the application is to facilitate the management and use of the cinema through a simple and
intuitive interface.
